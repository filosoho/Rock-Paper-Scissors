# Introduction

Welcome to the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors! This is a small text-based game where you will be playing against the computer. Choose your weapon wisely, and good luck!

# How to Play

To play the game, simply run the script in a Python environment. The game will ask you if you want to play Rock-Paper-Scissors. Type 'y' or 'n' and press enter.

If you choose to play, you will be prompted to choose your weapon by typing the corresponding number:
